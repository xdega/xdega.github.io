### Hello 2022: Blogging is Hard?

As a new year is upon us, it's clear by my posts (or lack thereof) that Consistently Blogging is very challenging for me. I am going to try and post updates here, but I also have some other exciting projects for this year.

First off, I want to continue to grow in my mastery of both PHP and JavaScript. I am also building my first component library, written in TypeScript and facilitated by Storybook. Additionally, this will be an open-source library and my first published package on npm.

I am also looking to partner with some clients in the non-profit sector, where I wish to bring my years of expertise to create meaningful projects that help make the world a better place.

That's it. Short and sweet. Until next time!
