title: "A New Start... Again"

description: "When it comes to personal websites, starting anew is often a good 
thing. It allows you to dive into new tools and technologies, to discover new 
workflows, and generally grow as an engineer. Since I have started a new job and
I am no longer in the middle of a grueling search for work, it is time to revisit 
my personal website."

## What's Gone?

No more Jenkins template-based project. While I do have a reasonable mastery of 
Ruby (in particular Rails), I wanted to write something based on tools that I 
personally prefer (JS, React).

I am no longer deep in a job search, so gone is the portfolio and resume links 
...for now. I want to focus my efforts on building a single feature first, a Blog,
and committing to it.

## What's New?

When I rebuilt this website, I wanted to make sure it gave me a platform to truly
put on display my growing mastery of modern JS and related tools and technologies. 

I wanted to build something statically generated and opted to go with Gatsby for 
the task, due to the vibrant plugin market and good support for markdown parsing.

I had a lot of fun in the process. Much like with my previous Jenkins project, 
all my blog posts are simply markdown files. This time I decided I wanted to 
write a script to quickly generate a new blog post template.

## What's Next?

Next up? Well. This is just, essentially, an "MVP". I want to add new pages, 
features, and continue to polish the layout and styling. I do, however, want the
design to remain minimal. That's my style, my brand.

Another thing I want to do here, is to finally dive into Unit Testing with Jest.
At the moment I have a lot to learn in terms of how to write good unit tests, 
in particular how to approach implementation of testing to an existing system. 

Watch this space, as there will probably be a blog post (or a few) which talk
about my adventures in Jest.
