description: "<strong>Palm Business Center</strong> is a freelance project for a client in Palm, PA. 
  The current website was over 10 years old, lacked mobile support, and was no longer being 
  maintained. I determined that WordPress would be ideal for this project due to the scope 
  and scale. I opted to use Twig for cleaner templates, via a plugin called Timber. I also 
  implemented a modern JS/CSS workflow to enable cleaner source code for assets and optimized 
  output."
