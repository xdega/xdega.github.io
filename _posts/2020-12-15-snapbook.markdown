description: "I built <strong>Snapbook</strong> as a place to freely share my photography in full quality 
  while delving into some new technologies. This project was built using React, along with Firebase Auth, 
  Realtime Database, Storage, and Hosting. TailwindCSS was used to facilitate a declarative approach 
  to CSS styling. This was my first foray into the wonderful world of React and it laid a firm foundation 
  in my understanding of frontend JavaScript frameworks."
