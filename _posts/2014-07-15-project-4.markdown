description: "I often begin new projects with a reasonable boilerplate. This project is an open-source Github 
  template repository that I built to facilitate the rapid creation of new reactive frontend applications 
  with React. This includes additional tooling for Tailwind, Webpack, and PostCSS. This supports a clean 
  asset pipeline with a delarative approach to CSS styling via Tailwind."
