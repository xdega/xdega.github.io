  <strong>Webfresh</strong> was an experiment in branding, as well as a project that allowed me to 
  dive deep into a full, thoughtful, design process, and to continue to hone and sharpen my 
  skills. Beginning with Figma, I created a mobile-first design mockup, then an HTML prototype, 
  finally a full frontend build in React. The backend is powered by a JSON:API rest API, served
  by Drupal.
