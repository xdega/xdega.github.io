description: "<strong>Drupal Char Count</strong> is my first official open-source contributed module, 
  submitted to the Drupal project. While the functionality of this module is relatively simple, it 
  allowed me to become familiar with the open-source contribution process that is facilitated by 
  Drupal.org."
