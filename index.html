    As a coder, I enjoy working on diverse projects -- keen to brainstorm the cleanest or most visually elegant way to solve a problem, integrate feedback, or improve the user experience. As a strong team-player, I love to share ideas and assist my peers. Personable and down-to-earth, I thrive when given independent projects and in a collaborative environment.
