While I do have a reasonable mastery of\nRuby (in particular Rails), I wanted to write something based on tools that I\npersonally prefer (JS, React).</p>\n<p>I am no longer deep in a job search, so gone are the portfolio and resume links\n…for now. I want to focus my efforts on building a single feature first, a Blog,\nand committing to it.</p>\n<h2>What’s New?</h2>\n<p>When I rebuilt this website I wanted to make sure it gave me a platform to truly\ndisplay my growing mastery of modern JS, with related tools and technologies.</p>\n<p>I wanted to build something statically generated and opted to go with Gatsby for\nthe task, due to it’s vibrant plugin market and good support for markdown parsing.</p>\n<p>I had a lot of fun in this process. Much like with my previous Jenkins project,\nall my blog posts are simply markdown files. This time, however, I decided I wanted\nto write a script to quickly generate a new blog post boilerplate.</p>\n<h2>What’s Next?</h2>\n<p>Next up? Well. This is just, essentially, an “MVP”. I want to add new pages,\nfeatures, and continue to polish the layout and styling. I do, however, want the\ndesign to remain minimal. That’s my style, my brand.</p>\n<p>Another thing I want to do here, is to finally dive into Unit Testing with Jest.\nAt the moment I have a lot to learn in terms of how to write good unit tests,\nin particular how to approach implementation of testing to an existing system.</p>\n<p>Watch this space as there will probably be a blog post (or a few) which talk\nabout my adventures in Jest, etc.</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"A New Start... Again","date":"19 June, 2021","description":"When it comes to personal websites, starting anew is often a good  thing. It allows you to dive into new tools and technologies, to discover new  workflows, and generally grow as an engineer. Since I have started a new job and I am no longer in the middle of a grueling search for work, it is time to revisit  my personal website."}},"previous":null,"next":{"fields":{"slug":"/lets-start-testing/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Let's Start Testing"}}},"pageContext":{"id":"60a547e5-0e38-5b7a-8d88-8a657693e829","previousPostId":null,"nextPostId":"87be194b-cf93-58df-a3ad-c9b6a53ed215"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3000541721"]}
