I am going to try and post updates here, but I also have some other exciting projects for this year.</p>\n<p>First off, I want to continue to grow in my mastery of both PHP and JavaScript. I am also building my first component library, written in TypeScript and facilitated by Storybook. Additionally, this will be an open-source library and my first published package on npm.</p>\n<p>I am also looking to partner with some clients in the non-profit sector, where I wish to bring my years of expertise to create meaningful projects that help make the world a better place.</p>\n<p>That’s it. Short and sweet. Until next time!</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Hello 2022: Blogging is Hard?","date":"13 January, 2022","description":"This last year has been a real challenge to add content to this blog.
